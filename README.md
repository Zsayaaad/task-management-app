## Features

- **User Authentication** — Register, login, and logout with JWT-based auth stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- **Project Management** — Create, update, delete, and list projects with search, sort, and pagination.
- **Task Management** — Create, update, delete, and list tasks with filtering by status, priority, and search.
- **Team Collaboration** — Add/remove project members by email. Only the project creator (or admin) can manage members.
- **Real-Time Chat** — Per-project messaging channels powered by Stream Chat. Task events (create, update, delete) are announced in the project chat automatically.
- **Video Meetings** — Per-project video calls using Stream Video with speaker layout and call controls.
- **User Profiles** — Update name, email, avatar (via ImageKit upload), and password. Delete account with password confirmation.
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Two roles: `ADMIN` (full access to all projects) and `MEMBER` (access only to projects they belong to).
- **Rate Limiting** — Redis-backed rate limits at global, auth, and sensitive-action levels.
- **Health Check Endpoint** — Reports service, database, and Redis status.

## Architecture

![System Architecture — Database as Source of Truth with Sync Outward + Retry Queue](docs/architecture.png)

### Database as Source of Truth + Sync Outward + Retry Queue

The central design principle is: **PostgreSQL is always the source of truth.** The API writes to the database first and returns immediately — the request never waits on a third-party service. External systems (Stream Chat, Stream Video, ImageKit) are then **synced outward** asynchronously via a **BullMQ job queue** backed by Redis.

If an external service is down, the database still has the data, and BullMQ retries the sync in the background with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts). This means:

- A project is **always created** in the database, even if Stream is unreachable.
- A member is **always added** to the project, even if the chat channel update fails.
- The user **always gets a fast response** — no blocking on slow third-party APIs.

### Modular Backend

The backend follows a **modular architecture** with each domain (auth, users, projects, tasks, stream, imagekit, health) organized into its own module containing `routes → controllers → services`, with shared middlewares for auth, validation, rate limiting, and project access control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22+
- **Redis** — either locally installed or via Docker
- **PostgreSQL** — a running PostgreSQL instance (e.g., [Neon](https://neon.tech), local, or Docker)
- **Stream** account — for chat and video ([getstream.io](https://getstream.io))
- **ImageKit** account — for image uploads ([imagekit.io](https://imagekit.io))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zsayaaad/task-management-app.git
cd task-management-app

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory based on `.env.example`:

```env
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?sslmode=require

JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

STREAM_API_KEY=your-stream-api-key
STREAM_API_SECRET=your-stream-api-secret

IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your-imagekit-public-key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=your-imagekit-private-key
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/your-imagekit-id

REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Backend server port (default: `3001`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development`, `production`, or `test` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for signing JWTs |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Token expiry duration (default: `7d`) |
| `STREAM_API_KEY` | Stream API key (from your Stream dashboard) |
| `STREAM_API_SECRET` | Stream API secret |
| `IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY` | ImageKit public key |
| `IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY` | ImageKit private key |
| `IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT` | ImageKit URL endpoint |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection URL (default: `redis://localhost:6379`) |

All environment variables are validated at startup using Zod. Missing or invalid values will cause the server to fail fast with a descriptive error.

### Database Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Generate the Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# (Optional) Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed
```

### Running the Project

**1. Start Redis** (using Docker Compose from the project root):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**2. Start the backend** (from `backend/`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API server starts at `http://localhost:3001`.

**3. Start the frontend** (from `frontend/`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` requests to the backend.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT tokens** are stored in HTTP-only, secure, strict-SameSite cookies (7-day expiry).
- On logout, tokens are added to a **Redis revocation list** so they cannot be reused.
- The auth middleware verifies the JWT and checks for revocation against Redis. If Redis is unavailable, the request is allowed through (fail-open).
- **Two roles** exist:
  - `ADMIN` — can access all projects and perform all operations.
  - `MEMBER` — can only access projects they are a member of.
- **Project-level authorization** — modifying or deleting a project requires being its creator or an admin. Accessing a project requires being a member or an admin.
- **Task-level authorization** — updating a task requires being the task creator, the task assignee, or an admin. Deleting a task requires being the task creator or an admin.

---

## Background Job Processing

External API calls to **Stream** and **ImageKit** are processed asynchronously via a **BullMQ** sync queue backed by Redis. This ensures:

- API responses are not blocked by slow third-party calls.
- Failed jobs are retried with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts: 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s).
- The worker processes up to 5 jobs concurrently.

**Job types handled by the sync worker:**

| Job Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `stream.channel.create` | Create a Stream chat channel for a new project |
| `stream.channel.update` | Rename a channel when a project is renamed |
| `stream.channel.delete` | Delete a channel when a project is deleted |
| `stream.member.add` | Add a user to a project's chat channel |
| `stream.member.remove` | Remove a user from a project's chat channel |
| `stream.announce` | Post a silent message to a project's chat (task events) |
| `imagekit.delete` | Delete an old avatar image from ImageKit |

---

## Docker

### Development (Redis only)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts a Redis 7 instance on port `6379` with persistent storage.

### Production Build

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build to create a single container that serves both the API and the frontend:

```bash
docker build -t projectflow .
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file backend/.env projectflow
```

**Build stages:**
1. **frontend-build** — Installs frontend dependencies and runs `vite build`.
2. **backend-build** — Installs backend dependencies, generates Prisma client, and compiles TypeScript.
3. **runner** — Installs only production dependencies, copies build artifacts, and serves everything from `node dist/index.js`. Express serves the SPA static files from `public/` and API routes from `/api/v1`.

---

## Seed Data

The seed script (`npm run seed` in `backend/`) resets the database and creates sample data:

| Account | Email | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin User | `admin@example.com` | `Admin123!` | `ADMIN` |
| Alex Johnson | `member@example.com` | `Member123!` | `MEMBER` |
| Sarah Smith | `member2@example.com` | `Member123!` | `MEMBER` |
| David Chen | `member3@example.com` | `Member123!` | `MEMBER` |

The seed also creates sample projects with tasks assigned across members.

---

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included at `postman/projectflow.postman_collection.json`. Import it into Postman to test all API endpoints.

---

## Important Implementation Details

- **Graceful Shutdown** — The server handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals by stopping new connections, draining in-flight requests, closing the BullMQ worker/queue, Redis, and Prisma connections, and force-exiting after 10 seconds if draining stalls.
- **Prisma Adapter Pattern** — Uses `@prisma/adapter-pg` for direct PostgreSQL driver integration rather than the default Prisma query engine.
- **Zod Environment Validation** — All environment variables are validated and typed with Zod at startup. Invalid configuration fails fast.
- **Request Validation** — All request bodies and query parameters are validated using Zod schemas via a reusable `validate` middleware.
- **Rate Limiting** — Three tiers of Redis-backed rate limiting:
  - **Global**: 300 requests / 15 min / IP across the entire API.
  - **Auth**: 5 requests / 15 min / IP for login and registration.
  - **Sensitive**: 10 requests / 15 min / IP for project creation, task creation, and image upload auth.
- **Stream Chat Sync** — Each project maps 1:1 to a Stream messaging channel (`project-<projectId>`). Task lifecycle events are posted as silent messages.
- **React Query Caching** — Default stale time of 5 minutes. Query invalidation is handled through React Router actions.
- **Vite Dev Proxy** — The frontend proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3001` during development, matching the production architecture where Express serves both API and static files.
